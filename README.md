# Corona Virus Mitigation App for Android & IOS

This project was created to assist in the current efforts to turn smartphones into a tool to mitigate, control and stop the spread of the corona virus or any other viral outbreak.
Since the publication of corona related apps requires government approval, this repository is intended to help developers and public officials who are actively working on Covid 19 related issues by introducing and sharing, code,features, ideas and possibilities to stop the viral outbreak.

## Current Implementation 

- Contains over 1 Million Corona virus related data points, which are available online or offline. 
- Data points updates are in sync with covid 19 related statistics shared by each country.
- The app shows relevant data points for all countries and major cities (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION). 
- An anonymous account is automatically created to protect the privacy (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
- All active cases can be shared via the app by using the users unique device ID (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION). 
- Active cases will be updated every 24 hours allowing users world wide to gain insights into affected areas (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
- A geographical fence is created on the map around the users who shared that they are infected with the virus. The fence is currently set to 3km in diameter to notify other users within the geographical zone of the corona status (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
- Contains a 7-day projection for each country and city by using country wide growth rates (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
- The design of the map can be changed to one of the 6 presets available.
- The user can easily navigate between bookmarked countries and cities.
- Users can compare the growth rates, recovery rates, death rates... and much more.
- Zoom into a cluster of countries or cities by clicking on the appropriate red circle hovering over the desired region.  


## Future Implementation
- [ ] To share active status users must enter personal information.
- [ ] Aside from cities and countries, provincial data can also be shared.
- [ ] Users can control how accurate the shared location should be, therefore introducing a degree of privacy and anonymity. 
- [ ] A danger zone feature is introduced, allowing the user to determine how large the geographical fence should of a recorded cases, therefore controlling the number of notifications if the user resides in highly populated areas.
- [ ] The user is notified to take the appropriate precautions when leaving home.
- [ ] Future growth projections will be assisted by machine learning algorithms to determine how the news within the users country affect the spread of the virus. Also a prediction of potential viral infection (threat level) can be shared by using the users location history and comparing it to the number of recorded cases nearby. 
- [ ] Provide Corona News Feed tailored to each country.
- [ ] Establish community groups to allow users to actively engage with people who had, have and/or suffer any consequences due to the corona outbreak.
