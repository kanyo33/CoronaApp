# Corona Virus Mitigation App for Android & IOS

This project was created to assist in the current efforts to turn smartphones into a tool to mitigate, control and stop the spread of the corona virus or any other viral outbreak.
Since the publication of corona related apps requires government approval, this repository is intended to help developers and public officials who are actively working on Covid 19 related issues by introducing and sharing, code,features, ideas and possibilities to stop the viral outbreak.

## Current Implementation 

- Contains over 1 Million Corona virus related data points, which are available online and offline. 
- The data points fetched are live and in sync with the statistics shared by each country.
- The app shows relevant data points for all countries and major cities (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION). 
- An anonymous account is automatically created to simplify data access and protect the users privacy (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
- All active cases can be shared via the app by using the users unique device ID (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION). 
- Active cases shared by users of the app are updated every 24 hours allowing users world wide to gain insights into affected areas and control the flow of information (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
- A geographical fence is created on the map around the users who shared that they are infected with the virus. The fence is currently set be 3km in diameter to notify other users within the geographical fence (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
- Contains a 7-day projection for each country and city by using country wide growth rates (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
- The design of the map can be changed to one of the 6 presets available.
- The user can easily navigate between bookmarked countries and cities.
- Users can compare the growth rates, recovery rates, death rates... and much more.
- Zoom into a cluster of countries or cities by clicking on the appropriate red circle hovering over the desired region.  


## Future Implementation
- [ ] If a user tested positive for covid 19, the users personal information must be entered to share the current status with other users.
- [ ] Aside from cities and countries, provincial data can also be shared.
- [ ] Users can control how accurate the shared location should be, therefore introducing a degree of privacy, anonymity and uncertainty to prevent users from navigating through crowds relying solely on the app.  
- [ ] Gamify the App by introducing points, credits and badges when users take the appropriate measures to mitigate the viral spread. 
    - [ ] Add city wide and global leadership boards to introduce positive reinforcement and public validation to encourage users to take the appropriate precautions. 
- [ ] A danger zone feature is introduced to determine how large the geographical fence should of a recorded case, therefore controlling the number of notifications if the user, for example, lives in highly populated areas.
- [ ] The user is notified to take the appropriate precautions when leaving their home.
- [ ] Future growth projections will be assisted by machine learning algorithms to determine how the news affect the spread of the virus. Also, a prediction of  the potential to attract the virus when leaving the house can be developed by using the location history and comparing it to the number of recorded cases nearby. 
- [ ] Create Corona News Feed tailored to each country.
- [ ] Establish community groups to allow users to actively engage with people who had, have and/or suffer any consequences due to the corona outbreak.
