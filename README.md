## Corona Virus Mitigation App for Android & IOS

This project was created to assist in the current efforts to turn smartphones into a tool to mitigate, control and stop the spread of the corona virus or any viral outbreak that may follow.
Since the publication of corona related apps requires government approval, this repository is intended to help developers and public officials who are actively working on this issue by introducing and sharing ,code ,features, ideas and possibilities.

## Current Implementation 

- Over 1 Million Corona virus related data points available online or offline. 
- Data points updates are in sync with publications made by each country.

- An anonymous account is automatically created to protect the users privacy (Sign up could be added).
- All active cases can be shared via the app by using a users unique device ID. - Active cases will be visible to all users.
- The exact location is not shared, instead, a geographical fence is created around the user which is current set to 3km in diameter to protect the users exact location and spread to awareness to individuals nearby by forwarding a notification of the active status (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
- The design of the map can be changed to one of the 6 presets available.
- The user can view global cases by bookmarking the desired countries and major cities. 
- Contains a written template for a Privacy contract and a Terms and Conditions.
- Contains a 7-day projection for each country and city by using the general growth rate (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
