## Corona Virus Mitigation App for Android & IOS

This project was created to assist in the current efforts to turn smartphones into a tool to mitigate, control and stop the spread of the corona virus or any viral outbreak that may follow.
Since the publication of corona related apps requires government approval, this repository is intended to help developers and public officials who are actively working on this issue by introducing and sharing ,code ,features, ideas and possibilities. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>To Access Code Open AppCode folder</h3>

## Current Implementation 

- Over 1 Million Corona virus related data points available online or offline. 
- Data points updates are in sync with publications made by each country.
- The app shows relevant data points for all countries and major cities. 
- An anonymous account is automatically created to protect the users privacy (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
- All active cases can be shared via the app by using a users unique device ID. - Active cases will be visible to all users.
- A geographical fence is created around the user which is currently set to 3km in diameter to notify others users within the geographical zone of the corona case (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
- The design of the map can be changed to one of the 6 presets available.
- The user can view global cases by bookmarking the desired countries and major cities. 
- Contains a written template for a Privacy contract and a Terms and Conditions.
- Contains a 7-day projection for each country and city by using the general growth rate (SEE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION).
- Users can compare the growth rates, recovery rates, death rates... and much more.
- Zoom into a cluster of countries or cities by clicking on the appropriate red circle that pools together certain regions for better performance.  


## Future Implementation
- [ ] To share Active Status user must enter personal information 
- [ ] The user can control how accurate the location should be 
- [ ] A danger zone features is introduced allowing the user to determine how large the geographical zone should be of an affected case and how many cases are perceived as a potential threat.
- [ ] The user is notified to take the appropriate precautions when leaving home.
- [ ] Future growth projections will be assisted by machine learning algorithms to determine how the news within the users country affect the spread of the virus.
- [ ] Aside from cities and countries, provincial data could possibly be added.
- [ ] Provide Corona News Feed tailored to each country.
- [ ] Establish community groups to allow users to actively engage with people who had, have and/or suffer any consequences due to the corona outbreak.
